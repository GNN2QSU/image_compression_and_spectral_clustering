# Image Compression and Spectral Clustering
this project contains 2 parts:
1. Image compression using KMeans algorithm
2. Spectral clustering of USA football team play-graph

Analysis and reports (.ipynb and .html files) can be found in their respective folders in '/notebook/' folder.

## 1. Image Compression
Content: manual implementation of KMeans with different initialization strategies (random uniform, random data, kmeans++) and similarity measures (l1 and l2 distances)
Example:

KMeans image compression with k = 2, 4, 6, 8 and original
